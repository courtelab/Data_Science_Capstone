# Data_Science_Capstone
MOOC on Data Science with HarvardX

For this project, the idea is to create a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset with R.
The version of movielens included in the dslabs package (which was used for some of the exercises in EDX.ORG PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning) is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings. You can find the entire latest MovieLens dataset here(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).
The project is to create a recommendation system using all the tools shown in the EDX course.
We use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier.

In this project, the R script generates an image of all variables. Then the markdown version use the image to show the results without computing.
